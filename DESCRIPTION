Title: Statistical inference based on the Sorensen-Dice dissimilarity
        and the Gene Ontology (GO)
Version: 1.9.0
Description: This package implements inferential methods to compare gene lists in terms of their biological meaning as expressed in the GO. The compared gene lists are characterized by cross-tabulation frequency tables of enriched GO items. Dissimilarity between gene lists is evaluated using the Sorensen-Dice index.
    The fundamental guiding principle is that two gene lists are taken as similar if they share a great proportion of common enriched GO items.

\title{Example of the output produced by the function \code{allEquivTestSorensen} using the approximated bootstrap distribution.}
\format{
An exclusive object from \code{goSorensen} of the class "AllEquivSDhtest"
}
\usage{
data(allEqTests_boot)
}
\description{
This object contains all the outputs for the equivalence tests to compare all possible pairs of lists from \code{\link{allOncoGeneLists}} across GO-Levels 3 to 10, and for the ontologies BP, CC, and MF, using the approximated bootstrap distribution.
}
\details{
The parameters considered to execute these tests are: irrelevance limit \code{d0 = 0.4444} and confidence level \code{conf.level = 0.95}.

Consider this object only as an illustrative example, which is valid exclusively for the data \code{\link{allOncoGeneLists}} contained in this package. Note that gene lists, GO terms, and Bioconductor may change over time. The current version of these results were generated with Bioconductor version 3.20.

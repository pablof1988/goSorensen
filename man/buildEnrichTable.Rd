\arguments{
\item{x}{either an object of class "character" (or coerzable to "character") representing a
vector of gene identifiers (e.g., ENTREZ) or an object of class "list". In this second case, each
element of the list must be a "character" vector of gene identifiers (e.g., ENTREZ). Then, all pairwise
contingency tables between these gene lists are built.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters for internal use (not used for the moment)}

\item{y}{an object of class "character" (or coerzable to "character") representing a vector
of gene identifiers (e.g., ENTREZ).}

\item{listNames}{a character(2) with the gene lists names originating the cross-tabulated
enrichment frequencies. Only in the "character" or default interface.}

\item{check.table}{Logical The resulting table must be checked. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{geneUniverse}{character vector containing the universe of genes from where gene lists have been extracted. This vector must be obtained from the annotation package declared in \code{orgPackg}. For more details, refer to vignette \href{../doc/goSorensen_Introduction.html}{goSorensen_Introduction}.}

\item{orgPackg}{A string with the name of the genomic annotation package corresponding to a specific species to be analyzed, which must be previously installed and activated. For more details, refer to vignette \href{../doc/goSorensen_Introduction.html}{goSorensen_Introduction}.}

\item{onto}{string describing the ontology. Either "BP", "MF" or "CC".}

\item{GOLevel}{An integer, the GO ontology level.}

\item{storeEnrichedIn}{logical, the matrix of enriched (GO terms) x (gene lists) TRUE/FALSE values,
must be stored in the result? See the details section}

\item{pAdjustMeth}{string describing the adjust method, either "BH", "BY" or "Bonf", defaults to 'BH'.}

\item{pvalCutoff}{adjusted pvalue cutoff on enrichment tests to report}

\item{qvalCutoff}{qvalue cutoff on enrichment tests to report as significant.
Tests must pass i) pvalueCutoff on unadjusted pvalues, ii) pvalueCutoff on adjusted pvalues and
iii) qvalueCutoff on qvalues to be reported}

\item{parallel}{Logical. Defaults to FALSE but put it at TRUE for parallel computation.}

\item{nOfCores}{Number of cores for parallel computations. Only in "list" interface.}
}
\value{
in the "character" interface, an object of class "table".
It represents a 2x2 contingency table, the cross-tabulation of
the enriched GO terms in two gene lists: "Number of enriched GO terms in list 1
(TRUE, FALSE)" x "Number of enriched Go terms in list 2 (TRUE, FALSE)".
In the "list" interface, the result is an object of class "tableList" with all
pairwise tables.
Class "tableList" corresponds to objects representing all mutual enrichment contingency tables
generated in a pairwise fashion:
Given gene lists (i.e. "character" vectors of gene identifiers) l1, l2, ..., lk,
an object of class "tableList" is a list of lists of
contingency tables t(i,j) generated from each pair of gene lists i and j, with the
following structure:

$l2

$l2$l1$t(2,1)

$l3

$l3$l1$t(3,1), $l3$l2$t(3,2)

...

$lk

$lk$l1$t(k,1), $lk$l2$t(k,2), ..., $lk$l(k-1)t(K,k-1)
}
\description{
Creates a 2x2 enrichment contingency table from two gene lists, or all pairwise contingency
tables for a "list" of gene lists.
}
\details{
If the argument \code{storeEnrichedIn} is TRUE (the default value), the result of
\code{buildEnrichTable} includes an additional attribute \code{enriched} with a matrix
of TRUE/FALSE values. Each of its rows indicates if a given GO term is enriched or not in each one
of the gene lists (columns). To save space, only GO terms enriched in almost one of the gene lists
are included in this matrix.

Also to avoid redundancies and to save space, the result of \code{buildEnrichTable.list}
(an object of class "tableList", which is itself an aggregate of 2x2 contingency tables
of class "table") has the attribute \code{enriched} but its table members do not have
this attribute.

The default value of argument \code{parallel} Ã­s "FALSE" and you
may consider the trade of between the time spent in initializing parallelization and the possible
time gain when parallelizing. It is difficult to establish a general guideline, but parallelizing
is only worthwhile when analyzing many gene lists, on the order of 30 or more, although it depends
on each computer and each application.
